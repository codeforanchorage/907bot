-- Notes and Specs for v1.1.0

Retool the overly con-formative responses userâ€™s are required to send;
  (yes|no) when prompted.

    -- Solved: Added tagging of the incoming phrase with Natural classifiers,
      Interjections, Resources, and Core Commands.

-  Add natural language processing to pre-determined response types
    -yes or no answer (yeah, ok, yep, yes, no, nope, nada)

    -- Solved: Above.

Changing the default business flow to: Users will be asked to Register
on the first initial contact, then asked about their organizational affiliation.
  - Rework cookie and business process flow, force user to register and associate
  before proceeding to the command process.

    -- Solved: New Business Flow
      1. New users are asked to register.
      2. Help command is presented.
      3. Subscribe (n):
        - New users are asked for their organization name.
        - User is associated with an organization, and subscribed to (n).
        - (n) List of commands related to (n) is presented.

Create a PROFILE command so users can review what details we have for them
(Resource Associations, Organization, SMS Alerts (status: On | Off)).
  - Create Profile command, return:
    {
    'name': 'Jim Davis',
    'organization': 'Beans Cafe',
    'resources': ['101 04', '101 04'],
    'alerts': true,
    }

    -- InProcess: buffering

Integrate the weather in a meaningful way on the dashboard
(I am super close on this).
  -Mockup UI integration, wire up live data.
  -Cache weather results against 20min window.

Re-work the taxonomy search so it has friendlier API.
  - Can return the name of resource from the ID.

    -- Skipping: Focus on a single resource, Emergency Shelter (101-04)

Re-work the initial broadcast of data to a 'client request' vs.
a forced push on connect.
