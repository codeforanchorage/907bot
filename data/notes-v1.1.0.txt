-- Notes and Specs for v1.1.0

Retool the overly con-formative responses userâ€™s are required to send;
  (yes|no) when prompted.

-  Add natural language processing to pre-determined response types
    -yes or no answer (yeah, ok, yep, yes, no, nope, nada)

Changing the default business flow to: Users will be asked to Register
on the first initial contact, then asked about their organizational affiliation.
  - Rework cookie and business process flow, force user to register and associate
  before proceeding to the command process.

Create a PROFILE command so users can review what details we have for them
(Resource Associations, Organization, SMS Alerts (status: On | Off)).
  - Create Profile command, return:
    {
    'name': 'Jim Davis',
    'organization': 'Beans Cafe',
    'resources': ['101 04', '101 04'],
    'alerts': true,
    }

Integrate the weather in a meaningful way on the dashboard
(I am super close on this).
  -Mockup UI integration, wire up live data.
  -Cache weather results against 20min window.

Re-work the taxonomy search so it has friendlier API.
  - Can return the name of resource from the ID.

Re-work the initial broadcast of data to a 'client request' vs.
a forced push on connect.
